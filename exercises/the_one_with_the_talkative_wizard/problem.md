Hello, JavaScript-ing wizard! Through out your journeys, you may have heard of a beast, only spoken about in hushed tones. This, of course, is the beast known as "The Event Loop." Some consider it to be a myth. Some think it is the work of an evil being unknown. Some have even claimed to have mastery of it! 

Well, young wizard, your time has come. The rumours are true: the beast exists. The event loop is as real as the lack of need for semicolons. And it's in your code, too. Young wizard, I may not know your name, and I cannot query you for it since this is a workshopper, but I know that you have the power to tame the beast that is the event loop.

Through this series of *mystical codes* I have written for you, you will learn the ins-and-outs of the event loop. And once you felt you have mastered the event loop, you have but one mission: to spread the knowledge you have learned to your fellow wizards, so they, too, can be one with the event loop.

# A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR

This workshopper is a bit different from others: It is an interactive story written from the perspective of Bruggie the Sometimes Great, a programming wizard with a fantastical vocabulary, and a love for teaching. You just read his first message to you above. With every chapter, Bruggie will conjure a file in your current directory for you to run. Every file has comments explaining the lesson given, so make sure to look through those. It's recommended you create a new folder for this workshopper, so that everything is nicely contained. 

This first chapter is very easy to complete; just run the following command: `{appname} verify .` (Don't forget the period!)
