Thanks for letting me share my knowledge with you! It gives me great joy that someone else can learn from what I know, and become a greater programmer (or wizard) because of it. I implore you to pass on your findings to others, and help spread this shared knowledge. This is what I have been taught, and so it is what I teach to you.

Good luck, and happy wizarding!
