We did it! We completed our adventure! Thanks for joining me, as I had a lot of fun. It gives me great joy that someone else can learn from what I know, and become a greater programmer (or wizard) because of it. I implore you to pass on your findings to others, as we can all learn better together. This is what I have been taught, and so it is what I teach to you. :-)

Good luck, and happy wizarding!
