Nice! Functionally, that was equivalent to the first example, but we used `setTimeout` so that the event loop was never blocked. This means that our app could keep doing other things at the same time. In the case of a web browser, this also means that the browser wouldn't be locked up, which is very important for user experience. Whenever you have to delay something, asynchronous APIs are the way to do it.

Now, you might be thinking, "Well, if asynchronous APIs run in another thread, can't I use a synchronous API, and still have my async methods run when I want them to?" Well... no, young wizard. This is where the beast of the event loop bites. Our next chapter shall explain why. Run `going-loopy` to continue.
