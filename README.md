# Going Loopy

A quest to tame the beast that is the JavaScript event loop.

## Installation

*WIP! Not released on npm yet. To install for now:*

```
git clone https://github.com/remixz/going-loopy.git
cd going-loopy
npm install
npm link
```

---

```
npm install going-loopy --global
```

## Usage

```
going-loopy
```

## Why?

I've been asked one too many times in an interview to explain the event loop. Afterwards, I'm always a bit worried that I missed a part, or didn't explain something adequately. So, I figured that if I create a story involving my character Bruggie, the Sometimes Great Wizard, explaining the event loop to another fellow wizard, I would get it down pat.

... Right?

As well, I've always wanted to create a workshop. They're fun to work through, and super informative. I also just like creative writing. I hope I can bring back Bruggie, the Sometimes Great, in some sort of story again.

## Thanks

I finally "got" the event loop when I watched [Philip Roberts'](https://twitter.com/philip_roberts) talk at JSConf EU 2014: ["What the heck is the event loop anyway?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ). If you are looking for a video walkthrough of the event loop, I highly recommend it. It's comprehensive, but at the same time easy for a beginner to understand. So, I owe thanks to Philip for making that. :smile:
